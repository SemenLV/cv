## Summary
With over 20 years in technology, I bring a deep background in data engineering to my current role as a Senior Platform Engineer. I specialize in designing and automating cutting-edge cloud platforms, with extensive experience building scalable, containerized ETL pipelines on AWS and leading large-scale data migrations from on-premises systems. My expertise in Go, Python, Kubernetes, and Terraform enables me to create robust, observable systems and CI/CD pipelines that bridge the gap between modern platform infrastructure and data-intensive applications.
